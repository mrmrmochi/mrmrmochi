### Hi there 👋

-⭐INTRO⭐

Hi, I'm (mrmrmochi🍡) and I am learning how to make games and animations. My top three video games in no particular order are Tomodachi Life, Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild ⚔, and Stardew Valley🌻.  


-INTERESTS

-Currently, I'm interested in game development in Unity and Unreal engine for PC, Console, and VR applications. My main passion is animation, both 2D and 3D. Animation is my most proficient skill in game development. 

-PROJECTS&LEARNING💡

I've made a few game projects in Godot, Game Maker, and Unity for PC. I have also made many animations, assets, and environments in Blender. Right now, I'm learning game development in Unity and C#. In the future, I'd like to learn a bit of game development with Unreal Engine 5 and continue with learning animation.
